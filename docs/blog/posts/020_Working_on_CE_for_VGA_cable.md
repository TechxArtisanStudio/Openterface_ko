Hey! 👋

Just wanted to drop a quick update about the VGA-to-HDMI cable that many of you have been excited about. We’re totally aware that some of you in the EU and UK can’t add this to your orders right now—we've hit a small bump on the road with the CE certification. 🚧

We're still hard at work coordinating with manufacturers and relevant parties to secure the CE certificate. Sorting out the paperwork behind the scenes can be a bit of a headache, but we’re pushing through and feeling optimistic about getting it all sorted out soon. 🌟

I’ll keep you all posted right here once we’ve got the green light.

Your patience and support are deeply appreciated and mean a lot to us! Thanks for sticking with us and being awesome! 🙌
